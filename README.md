ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Tony.

- :books: I focus on iOS augmented reality development. I gravitate towards thinking about and prototyping new ways for users to interact with augmented reality. My augmented reality & computer vision work has delved into depth estimation, semantic image segmentation, salience analysis, shared AR experiences, custom shaders, body motion capture, and facial tracking.
- :headphones: Iâ€™m currently working on my startup [Mytho](https://mytho.app).
